# Contao docker sandbox

This is me testing out docker to create sandbox copies of existing systems for development purposes. I am completely new to Docker, so it is advised not to trust anything I am doing here. First and foremost this is a learning project.

## Goals

The following goals should be acheived by the end (This is an early list and might change as I learn things):

* [ ] create a php container
* [ ] create an sql container
* [ ] install desired contao version
* [ ] copy project files (clone from github project?)
* [ ] use sqldump to copy the database
* [ ] configure contao

## Tools

The following tools might come in handy:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman)
* [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
